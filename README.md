# Covid-19-Analysis-and-Tracking
In this repo I will maintain a daily track of Covid-19 cases all round the world.<br />
For viewing both the Covid-19-Analysis and Covid-19-World-Map-Plot files on **NbViewer** (as it presents a rich view of the notebook) as github renders static images not dynamic plotly charts.<br />
**The links to NbViewer of the follwing files are :-**<br />
  **1) Covid-19-Analysis :-** https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sarveshggn/Covid-19-Analysis-and-Tracking/blob/master/Covid-19-Analysis.ipynb<br />
