# Covid-19-Analysis-and-Tracking
In this repo I will maintain a daily track of Covid-19 cases all round the world.<br />
<br />
For viewing both the Covid-19-Analysis and Covid-19-World-Map-Plot files on **NbViewer** (as it presents a rich view of the notebook) as github renders static images not dynamic plotly charts.<br />
<br />
**The links to NbViewer of the follwing files are :-**<br />
  **1) [Covid-19-Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sarveshggn/Covid-19-Analysis-and-Tracking/blob/master/Covid-19-Analysis.ipynb)<br />
  2) [Covid-19-World-Map-Plot](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sarveshggn/Covid-19-Analysis-and-Tracking/blob/master/Covid-19-World-Map-Plot.ipynb)<br />**
<br />
All these interactive plots are made with the help of **plotly** and **cufflinks**.<br />
This repo will be updated **daily** based on new cases.<br />
